# mRNA Vaccine Visualization (and cute frame for your vaccination record card)

Some [rad humans in California sequenced the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines and shared it][rad-humans].

I thought it was neat and wanted to make a pretty thing. I make no claims to the actual mRNA sequence(s). I turned strings of four letters into pictures and 3D objects.
